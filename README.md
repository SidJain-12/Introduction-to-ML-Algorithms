# Introduction-to-ML-Algorithms
## Purpose/Goals
Algorithms are a big part in the field of machine learning. You need to understand what algorithms are out there, and how to use them effectively.


This book describes the frequently used algorithms used in Machine Learning and Data Science that can be directly or indirectly linked to basic sorting, graph theory, DP and number theory algorithms.

## Overview
Machine learning is a buzzword for today's technology, and it is
growing very rapidly day by day. We are using machine learning in
our daily life even without knowing it such as Google Maps, Google
assistant, Alexa, etc.


We will start by discussing the difference between some popular
terms in data sciences like DL,ML,AI etc and then focus on how
fundamental algorithms and concepts are widely used in areas of ML
algorithms and its various subsets like RL.
