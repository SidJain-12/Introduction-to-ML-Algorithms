# Introduction-to-ML-Algorithms

Algorithms are a big part in the field of machine learning. You need to understand what algorithms are out there, and how to use them effectively.


This book describes the frequently used algorithms used in Machine Learning and Data Science that can be directly or indirectly linked to basic sorting, graph theory, DP and number theory algorithms.
